                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The player who succeeds in placing their 3 (defaults to 3 until other options available) of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Difficulty</h2>
                <p>The game supports three types of difficulty. Easy, Medium and Hard. With the difficulty set to easy, the AI randomly selects open positions to
                    place it's marks. With the difficulty set to medium, the AI is playing with a scoring function 50% of the time and thus may result in
                    mistakes when playing. With the difficulty set to hard, the AI will select only the best options that will result in either a victory or a tie.</p>

                <p>The default setting is set at medium</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Timer</h2>
                <p>The timer option is used to limit the AI in the time in which it gets to calculate the best possible state.
                The more time the AI gets, the more state it can potentially reach and thus will return a more optimal solution
                as the board size increases. Currently this version doesn't utilize a timer in it's MiniMax algorithm and thus
                will be released in the next version once Alpha Beta Pruning is fully implemented.</p>

                <h2>Dimension</h2>
                <p>Different board size will be supported in future installations. Currently the time it takes to process
                best state is not optimal and needs to be reevaluate, prior to enabling the 4x4 and 5x5 options.</p>
                <img src="src/image/dimension.png" alt="The dimension settings option within our game">
                <p>The default setting is set at 3x3 and other options will be enabled on future updates</p>

                <h2>In A Row</h2>
                <p>Based on the size of the board, the user is able to select the amount of marks in a row that will designate
                as a victory. For board size of 3x3 the only option is 3. But as the board scales up, the amount of marks in a row
                will vary from n (square board dimension) (n -1), (n -2) to 3. Thus boards with a dimension of 5x5 will be able to
                select options of 5, 4, 3 in a row.</p>
